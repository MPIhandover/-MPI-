1) You should run the installer software before inserting a
PRC50 into the PC.

2) If you have an older version of JSR Control Panel on the
target PC, you must completely uninstall that version first.

3) After running the uninstaller, some drivers may still need to 
be removed manually. Go to My Computer\Properties\Hardware\
Device Manager\ Use the right-click Uninstall option if
any of these drivers remain:
 Jungo
   Win Driver
 JSR Ultrasonics Pulsers/Receivers
   PCI Device
   PRC50

4) Unzip the complete zip file to a temporary folder before
running the exe file so the /Documentation/ folder can be found.

5) Restart the PC after installing the software.
